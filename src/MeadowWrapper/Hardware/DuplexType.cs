    //     and means that the write data is clocked (sent) out, and then the read data is
    //     clocked in only after write has finished. Protocols that only have a single data
    //     line (such as I2C) can only support half-duplex. Full-duplex is supported only
    //     on protocols that use two or more data lines (such as SPI) and means that data
    //     is clocked in at the same time as it is clocked out. Full-duplex peripherals
    //     are much less common than half-duplex.
